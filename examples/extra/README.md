# Extra Files

This folder contains additional Python scripts and experiments related to quantum computing financial analysis.

## Files

### 1.py
A basic quantum computing financial assistant that uses OpenAI's API to analyze website contents and identify quantum computing applications in financial markets. This script:
- Fetches website content using a scraper
- Uses GPT models to analyze content from a quantum finance perspective
- References key research papers on quantum computing in finance

### c_h_4_5.py
An object-oriented refactoring of the quantum finance analyzer. Features:
- `QuantumFinanceAnalyzer` class for structured website analysis
- Cleaner code organization with type hints
- References the same academic papers on quantum computing applications in finance

### g3.py
An enhanced version of the quantum computing financial analyzer with:
- Improved error handling
- Updated model configuration (GPT-4o-mini)
- More robust implementation with better code structure
- Comprehensive documentation and type hints

## Common Features

All scripts in this folder:
- Analyze websites for quantum computing applications in finance
- Use OpenAI's API for natural language processing
- Reference academic papers:
  - Nature paper on quantum computing applications
  - ScienceDirect article on quantum computing in finance
  - IEEE paper on quantum computing methods
- Require environment variables for API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Use a scraper module to fetch website content

## Usage

These files are experimental and may require additional dependencies not listed in the main requirements. They serve as examples of different approaches to the same problem: analyzing web content for quantum computing insights in finance.
